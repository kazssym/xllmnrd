This directory contains the source code for XLLMNRD.

XLLMNRD is an IPv6 LLMNR responder daemon (primarily for GNU/Linux operating
systems).  It allows Microsoft Windows clients to get the IPv6 address of a
server on the same local network _without any DNS configuration_ and
effectively complements IPv4-only NetBIOS name resolution provided by Samba.

XLLMNRD is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the
terms of the GNU General Public License.  You should be able to find a copy of
it in the 'COPYING' file.

# Installation
